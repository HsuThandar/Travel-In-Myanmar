                <h4>History Of Yangon</h4>
                <p>Formerly known as Rangoon, Yangon is a historical city and one of the most well-known cities in the country. Yangon was Myanmar’s administrative capital before Nay Pyi Taw was named as the capital city. Yangon is the country’s most prominent commercial centre as well as the largest city of the country with a population of more than 7 million people. The name ‘Yangon’ is a combination of the Burmese words ‘Yan’ meaning ‘enemies’ and ‘Koun’ meaning ‘run out of’. The combination of words commonly translates as ‘End of Strife’. During the colonial era, Yangon was called ‘Rangoon’. Till the mid-1990s, Yangon mostly had a traditional setting. As people started moving in, a necessity to expand the area of the city was felt. The city grew rapidly towards the north where the Yangon International Airport is located now. </p>

The cathedral’s exterior, of red brick, consists of spires and a bell tower. This construction of the cathedral took 17 years from 1893 to 1910. Five months later after the dedication, on 1 August 1911, Father Hendrick Janzen died and was interred at the entrance to the nave of the Cathedral. A plain inlaid marble slab indicated the spot written “I love the Lord, your family, the place of your Glory” could have been chosen to lay him to rest than within the walls of that magnificent edifice. And yet by an irony of fate, he lies there forgotten by the hundreds of Catholics who flock almost daily to the Cathedral, whilst only some of the visitors, mindful that he is in a place of worship and desirous of seeing the architectural beauties of the interior, stands in hushed and respectful silence at the foot of the grave and pays his genius at least the passing tribute of a sigh.</span></p>
